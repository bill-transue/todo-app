_Please spend no more than two hours on this exercise._

Instructions for rails take home:
1. Clone this repo
2. Complete the `#create` and `#update` actions in both controllers, making all the specs pass
3. Bonus points for rewriting the `routes.rb` using Railsâ€™s resources method while keeping the build green.
4. Return the completed code, the preferred method is with a `git bundle` by running `git bundle create completed_todo.bundle origin/main..HEAD` after commiting your changes and sending us the completed_todo.bundle file.
